# Expo AsyncStorage Error: Non-String Data

This repository demonstrates a common error when using AsyncStorage in Expo: attempting to store data that is not a string. AsyncStorage only accepts strings; any other data type will cause an error.  The error message isn't always helpful, so debugging can be challenging.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.
